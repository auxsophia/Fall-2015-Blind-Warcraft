# Blind Warcraft

Our intention is to design a suite of tools that can be installed onto the World of Warcraft video game allowing visually impaired and blind users to play the game independently.  The team is using the gameâ€™s front facing API and add-on support to adjust the interface to better accommodate players who cannot use the traditional interface system to receive information.  We plan to create and modify existing programs to allow for an expansive text to speech program that presents as much information as possible through audio cues, an improved interface system, and scripts which allow for independent movement and combat without outside help.

For more details, please refer to the [design document](./designDocument.pdf).
